# E--Commerce-Sales-Insights
This project presents a comprehensive sales performance analysis for an e-commerce business, built using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI Desktop. Leveraging a real-world dataset, the goal was to transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that drive smarter business decisions.

Using SQL, I cleaned and structured the data, performing key transformations to prepare it for analysis. In Power BI, I designed a fully interactive and responsive dashboard showcasing vital metrics such as total revenue, profit margins, top-selling categories, customer distribution, payment preferences, and region-wise performance.

The dashboard allows users to:

Monitor KPIs in real-time (Total Sales, Profit, Orders, AOV)

Drill down into state-wise and city-level sales

Visualize monthly sales trends and seasonality

Analyze top-performing product categories and sub-categories

Understand customer behavior through payment modes and quantity ordered

This end-to-end project demonstrates my capability in data modeling, ETL, visual storytelling, and business intelligence, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in a data-driven decision-making environment.
